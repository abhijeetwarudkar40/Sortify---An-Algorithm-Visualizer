# 🔢 Sortify – Algorithm & Data Structure Visualizer

Sortify is an interactive web-based visualization tool that helps users understand fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** through real-time animations and step-by-step execution.

It supports visualization of **sorting, searching, linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs, and trees**, making it a comprehensive learning platform for DSA.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Sorting Algorithms (`modules/sorting.js`)
- Step-by-step visualization of sorting operations  
- Animated comparisons and swaps  
- Speed control for better understanding  

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms (`modules/searching.js`)
- Visual representation of searching techniques  
- Helps understand how elements are located in data structures  

### 🔗 Linked List (`modules/linkedlist.js`)
- Node-based visualization  
- Supports insertion, deletion, and traversal  

### 📚 Stack (`modules/stack.js`)
- Visual push and pop operations  
- Demonstrates LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior  

### 🧾 Queue (`modules/queue.js`)
- Visual enqueue and dequeue operations  
- Demonstrates FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior  

### 🌐 Graph (`modules/graph.js`)
- Graph representation and traversal visualization  

### 🌳 Trees (`modules/trees.js`)
- Tree structure visualization  
- Helps understand hierarchical data representation
